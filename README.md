# xc

The best command to run most recent version of Xcode app on your machine.

## distinction

- **Short!** This command is short as `cd` and `ls` that use frequently!
- **Fast!** This command is blazingly fast to find and sort Xcode apps on the machine!
- **Easy!** This command is too easy to type and memorise so can even run Xcode app unconsciously!
